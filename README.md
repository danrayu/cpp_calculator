# cpp_calculator
A CPP (c++) calculator that deals with brackets, multiplication, powers, division, addition and subtraction. Functions like std::pow() were not used, instead local replacements are written. Example inputs:  
<ul>
<li>5 + 2*(2+(4/2+2))+1</li>
<li>2+100/(20-(5*4))</li>
<li>3.14*3^2</li>
<li>5+5+5+5+5   + 5</li>
<li>9+ 6*(3+8)^0 - actually doesn't work. will be fixed within hours</li>
</ul>
